## C.1 Getting Started

### C.1.1 Introduction
> **Note on terminology:** Many ecosystem proofs do not rely on the “zero-knowledge” property. Where possible we use neutral language such as **block proving** or **SNARK/STARK proving**.

Ethproofs V3 is a public-good platform designed to track, benchmark, and accelerate **block proving** for Ethereum’s Layer 1 (L1) execution blocks, supporting the ecosystem’s journey toward enshrined protocol proofs. It provides a neutral, transparent interface for provers, zkVM developers, researchers, and the Ethereum Foundation to collaborate on real-time proving of execution blocks (leanExecution / EVM 2.0). This section introduces new users to Ethproofs’ purpose, navigation, and core functionalities, offering a starting point for engaging with the platform’s data and contributing to Ethereum’s proving roadmap.

### C.1.2 Purpose & Scope
Ethproofs V3 aims to foster collaboration and competition in Ethereum’s proving ecosystem by providing credible, verifiable data through dashboards, proof explorers, and research tools. Its scope spans pre-Phase 0 (altruistic proving) to Phase 3 (enshrined proofs), focusing initially on **execution block proving** while laying the groundwork for consensus, data, and privacy proving. The platform ensures **neutrality**, **auditability**, and **accessibility**, serving as a trusted resource for benchmarking progress, enforcing contributor guardrails, and aligning with Ethereum’s leanEthereum vision. This section outlines Ethproofs’ objectives, target audience (provers, zkVM developers, researchers, Ethereum Foundation), and its role in driving scalable, decentralized proving solutions.
