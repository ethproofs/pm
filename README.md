# Ethproofs — Project Management (PM)

![Header](./assets/header.png)

This repository hosts the **Product Requirements Document (PRD)** for Ethproofs v3 and the **project board** we use to plan and track work. Use this repo for specs, milestones, and cross-repo coordination.

---

## Quick links

- 📄 **PRD (Ethproofs v3):** [`PRD.md`](./PRD/PRD.md)  
  _Purpose:_ Defines the vision, scope, features, verification guardrails, success metrics, and long-term roadmap for Ethproofs. Treat it as the single source of truth for product decisions and acceptance criteria.

- 🗺️ **Project Board:** [Ethproofs V3 Board](https://github.com/orgs/ethproofs/projects/2)  
  _Purpose:_ Plan, prioritize, and track deliverables across phases (spec, design, implementation, verification, docs).  
  **Columns:** Ideas → Spec’ing → In Progress → In Review → Verified → Done  
  _(TODO: adjust link/columns if your board differs.)_
